THe challenge included a set of 71 datasets.  Each data set contained a reference to a JSON data source. 
The JSON data source often limited our ability to find relevant keywords as a result of the complexity
and accessibility of the data.
Problems incurred:
* Inaccessible data (Restricted acess)
* Not easily accessible data (each data set had a specific method of accessing the subsets of data).
* Irrelavant data (data sets may reference information that is not relevant)

The solution to this may easily be found in keyword usage and keyword associations with the input of data
being the result of locating and storing indexes of all data
