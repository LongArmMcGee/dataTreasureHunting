(in press). Daily incident solar radiation was modelled assuming a cloud-free sky (Suri and Hofierka 2004). Sea ice data (AMSR-E sea ice concentration) were used as a mask: if sea ice was present on a given day then the solar radiation reaching the ocean surface was assumed to be zero. The annual light budget for a given pixel was therefore calculated as the sum of daily solar radiation values on all days when sea ice was not present. The values here are the mean annual light budget over the 2002/03 to 2010/11 austral summer seasons (1-Jul to 30-Jun). Calculations were made on the AMSR-E 6.25km polar stereographic grid, and then interpolated to the 0.1-degree rectangular grid using triangle-based linear interpolation.\nReferences: \nClark GF, Stark JS, Johnston EL, Runcie JW, Goldsworthy PM, Raymond B, Riddle MJ (in press) Light-driven tipping points in polar ecosystems.
