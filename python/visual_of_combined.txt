employment payroll labor statistics industry Economic Development Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages Quarterly Data: Beginning 2000 The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program (also known as ES-202) collects employment and wage data from employers covered by New York State's Unemployment Insurance (UI) Law. This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. "Covered" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI.

DCJS compiles these reports as New York’s official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Police agencies may experience reporting problems that preclude accurate or complete reporting. The counts represent only crimes reported to the police but not total crimes that occurred.

employment payroll labor statistics industry sic wages Economic Development Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) Historical Annual Data: 1975 - 2000 The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program (also known as ES-202) collects employment and wage data from employers covered by New York State's Unemployment Insurance (UI) Law. This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. 
"Covered" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. 
QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI. 
Industry level data from  1975 to 2000 is reflective of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.

sales and use tax sales tax distributions state and local sales tax state and local sales tax distributions Government & Finance State and Local Sales Tax Distributions: Beginning Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2003 The Department of Taxation and Finance administers the statewide New York State general retail sales and compensating use tax, as well as any general retail sales and compensating use tax imposed by a county or municipality in New York State. In addition, the Department administers any taxes imposed on consumer utilities services and other special taxes on selected commodities and services by municipalities and city school districts. This data set presents information on the amount of the distribution of these taxes back to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions during the ten most recent state fiscal years ended March 31. The state’s sales tax is distributed to the state during the same month of collection. Generally, all local sales taxes collected are distributed back to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction in the month subsequent to collection. A large majority of the distributions reflect collections from taxable sales reported and remitted during the preceding month. However, the net distributions also include adjustments for prior taxable sales periods resulting from resolving returns processing exception issues, and are also affected by timing of remittances by sales tax vendors as determined by their annual amount of taxable sales. Local taxing jurisdictions’ fiscal years are not identical to the state fiscal year. Distribution information in this data set is presented by state fiscal year to be consistent with other state tax collection information presented in the Annual Statistical Report of New York State Tax Collections. The sales tax distribution information in this data set can be found in this publication.

eitc earned noncustodial county Government & Finance Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Claims By Credit Type and Place Of Residence: Beginning 1999 The Department of Taxation and Finance annually prepares a mandated report of statistical information on New York State Earned Income Tax credit. Data in this dataset are from Table 3, 5 and 7 of the report. It includes the distribution of credit and average amount of credit by credit type and place of residence. A large proportion of EITC claims are paid out in the form of cash rebates to taxpayers. This is because credit claimants are typically low and moderate-income taxpayers who have little or no pre-credit tax liability. However, in a significant number of cases credit claims are used to offset pre-credit New York State tax liability. In the aggregate, approximately 85 percent of credit claimed is typically returned to taxpayers in the form of cash rebates.
