oregon new markets tax credit program 2014 oregon nmtc nmtc 2014 Revenue & Expense Oregon New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program: 2014 (update 1.26.15) (1.26.15 update) The Oregon Low Income Community Jobs Initiative (Oregon New Markets Tax Credit, or NMTC) program helps finance investments and create jobs in low-income communities; delivers below-market-rate investment options to Oregon businesses; attracts additional Federal New Market Tax Credit investments in Oregon; and sparks revitalization in Oregon’s low-income communities. The program is available to Community Development Entities (CDEs) serving Oregon that have been allocated Federal New Market Tax Credits. The Oregon new market tax credits are then provided to investors who make qualified equity investments in community development entities that in turn invest in projects located in low-income communities. Investments can only be made in qualified, existing low-income community businesses located in Oregon as defined by section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code. If you have additional questions, please contact Laura Engstrom at laura.engstrom@oregon.gov

contracts expired contracts agency expired contracts Revenue & Expense Summary of Expired Contracts - As of June 30, 2014 The following data is provided as an extract from the Statewide Procurement System (Oregon Procurement Information Network - ORPIN). It is a complete list of contracts that expired on or before June 30, 2014 and represents the full extent of electronic records of expired contracts that are tracked within ORPIN. The contract values reflected in the report are estimates only. Note: A number of contracts may indicate an “Amendment Date” that may exceed the “Expiration Date”. In these instances, the “Amendment Date” reflects an automated system time/date stamp that the system appends to the contract when the electronic version was accessed or modified, not necessarily when the legal instrument (the contract itself) was modified. Note: This report may not include contract information for the Oregon Judicial Department, Oregon State Lottery, Oregon University System, Oregon State Treasurer, or semi-independent state agencies, boards, and commissions. Some executive branch agencies have independent contracting authority for specific goods and services (e.g., Transportation, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Human Services, Fish and Wildlife, Parks and Recreation, Aviation, Economic and Community Development, Housing, Corrections, Veterans Affairs, Military, Education, and state agencies "specifically authorized" by any law outside the Code to "enter into a contract"). Thus, the ORPIN system may not capture contract information about those activities.

gas marina e-10 ethanol fuel fueling clear gasoline non-ethanol Recreation "Clear" Gasoline locations Where to buy clear gasoline in Oregon.  "Clear" gasoline is defined as a non-ethanol blended gas, generally produced with 91 octane and sold asa  premium blend.  Clear gasoline is a much better fuel for boats, ATV's, 1990 era and earlier car models, chainsaws, and yard equipment because of the rubber hoses, fuel lines, gaskets, etc. that can easily deteriorate with the use of ethanol-blended fuel.

contracts expired contracts agency expired contracts Revenue & Expense Summary of Expired Contracts - As of June 30, 2013 The following data is provided as an extract from the Statewide Procurement System (Oregon Procurement Information Network - ORPIN). It is a complete list of contracts that expired on or before June 30, 2013 and represents the full extent of electronic records of expired contracts that are tracked within ORPIN. The contract values reflected in the report are estimates only. Note: A number of contracts may indicate an “Amendment Date” that may exceed the “Expiration Date”. In these instances, the “Amendment Date” reflects an automated system time/date stamp that the system appends to the contract when the electronic version was accessed or modified, not necessarily when the legal instrument (the contract itself) was modified. Note: This report may not include contract information for the Oregon Judicial Department, Oregon State Lottery, Oregon University System, Oregon State Treasurer, or semi-independent state agencies, boards, and commissions. Some executive branch agencies have independent contracting authority for specific goods and services (e.g., Transportation, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Human Services, Fish and Wildlife, Parks and Recreation, Aviation, Economic and Community Development, Housing, Corrections, Veterans Affairs, Military, Education, and state agencies "specifically authorized" by any law outside the Code to "enter into a contract"). Thus, the ORPIN system may not capture contract information about those activities.

clean marinas boating clean boating marinas moorages floating homes marine board Natural Resources Certified Clean Marinas The Oregon Clean Marina program is a voluntary program working to protect and improve local water quality by promoting the usage of environmentally sensitive practices at marinas. The program provides the opportunity for marinas, boatyards, yacht clubs, and floating home moorages to receive recognition for helping to establish and promote a cleaner marine environment for Oregon.

If a facility is in compliance with existing environmental regulations and uses a high percentage of the recommended best management practices, it can be designated as an Oregon Clean Marina. Such certified marinas are authorized to fly the Clean Marina flag and use the logo in their advertising. The flag and logo are signals to boaters that a marina cares about the cleanliness of Oregon waterways.

The program also provides information to marine facility managers on how to eliminate or reduce the input of polluting materials – such as oil, paint, cleaning chemicals, sewage, fish waste, and trash – into the environment.

oregon places populated locations towns cities villages  Oregon Populated Places This point theme shows the location of populated places in the state of Oregon as derived from the 1:24,000 GNIS theme. 

    This dataset was created from the USGS GNIS database. Several SSCGIS staff members have worked on this theme over the years. 

Procedures_Used: The orppl theme was delineted from the 1990 GNIS theme. To get an idea how this coverage was created download the GNIS metadata. The orppl point theme was generated as the orcov theme. It was built for point topology after the theme was generated. it was than copied to oregnis. Arcedit was used to populate the coverage by selecting ppl from the desig item. The theme was again built for point topology. the theme was imported in 1991 and copied to the gniscov name. External was used 5 times to populate the database. the theme was then exported as gniscov. The gniscov was edited and built for point topology. Reselect was used twice. ArcEdit was used 6 times to edit the theme and than renamed to orppl. The theme was than built for point topology. The theme was than copied twice. One of these copies ws overlayed with house90 using the identity using the point .1 fuzzy tolerance and join options to join the two themes together. The theme was than copied to another directory. In the new directory the theme was edited 7 times and build for point topology. The theme was than renamed orppl and copied two more times. The theme was exported twice and built once between 1993 and 1995. The Projectcopy command was used to copy the projection info from the citylimits theme to the orppl. The theme was than exported twice and imported back in to be projected into the Oregon State transfer standard. The theme was built for point topology and imported back in so that metadata could be created for it.

 Revenue & Expense Summary of Expired Contracts - As of December 31, 2011 The following data is provided as an extract from the Statewide Procurement System (Oregon Procurement Information Network - ORPIN). It is a complete list of contracts that expired on or before December 31, 2011 and represents the full extent of electronic records of expired contracts that are tracked within ORPIN. The contract values reflected in the report are estimates only. 

Note: A number of contracts may indicate an “Amendment Date” that may exceed the “Expiration Date”.  In these instances, the “Amendment Date” reflects an automated system time/date stamp that the system appends to the contract when the electronic version was accessed or modified, not necessarily when the legal instrument (the contract itself) was modified. 

Note: This report may not include contract information for the Oregon Judicial Department, Oregon State Lottery, Oregon University System, Oregon State Treasurer, or semi-independent state agencies, boards, and commissions. Some executive branch agencies have independent contracting authority for specific goods and services (e.g., Transportation, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Human Services, Fish and Wildlife, Parks and Recreation, Aviation, Economic and Community Development, Housing, Corrections, Veterans Affairs, Military, Education, and state agencies "specifically authorized" by any law outside the Code to "enter into a contract"). Thus, the ORPIN system may not capture contract information about those activities.

business costs workers' compensation insurance rates rate ranking Business Workers' Compensation Costs, Percent of National Median, 1986-2010 The Information Management Division of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services conducts a state-by-state comparison of workers’ compensation rates every two years. The goal of this study is to produce a comparison of premium rates for a comparable set of classifications across all states. The study has been done because states’ economies, industries, and mix of occupations differ significantly. Therefore, simple analyses, such as overall average rates, are not comparable among states. The study uses a comparable set of occupational classes to address this problem. It uses the National Council on Compensation Insurance classification codes. Of the approximately 450 active classes in Oregon, 50 were selected based on relative importance as measured by share of losses in Oregon. 

This table provides the results of the surveys since 1986. However, the study methodology does impose some limitations on its use as a time series. The set of surveyed classes and associated payroll weights both change over time. To overcome this problem, the median rate index for each study was used as a benchmark, creating a data series of states’ rates as percentages of the median rate index for each study. Thus, a state’s rate index as a percentage of the median can be used as an indicator of its relative cost at a given point in time..

Users of this premium rate ranking study should be aware of some of the other issues in comparing premium rates among states. There are many factors that cannot be separately measured in each state, but that contribute to overall rate level and individual class rates. Users are referred to the report for more information on the methodology.

oregon corrections prisons infrastructure jails jail prison facilities detention federal state local justice doj Government Correctional Institutions The Jails and Prisons sub-layer is part of the Emergency Law Enforcement Sector and the Critical Infrastructure Category. A Jail or Prison consists of any facility or location where individuals are regularly and lawfully detained against their will. This includes Federal and State prisons, local jails, and juvenile detention facilities, as well as law enforcement temporary holding facilities. Work camps, including camps operated seasonally, are included if they otherwise meet the definition. A Federal Prison is a facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for the incarceration of individuals. A State Prison is a facility operated by a state, commonwealth, or territory of the US for the incarceration of individuals for a term usually longer than 1 year. A Juvenile Detention Facility is a facility for the incarceration of those who have not yet reached the age of majority (usually 18 years). A Local Jail is a locally administered facility that holds inmates beyond arraignment (usually 72 hours) and is staffed by municipal or county employees. A temporary holding facility, sometimes referred to as a "police lock up" or "drunk tank", is a facility used to detain people prior to arraignment. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded from the dataset. This definition of Jails is consistent with that used by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in their "National Jail Census", with the exception of "temporary holding facilities", which the DOJ excludes.

Locations which function primarily as law enforcement offices are included in this dataset if they have holding cells.

If the facility is enclosed with a fence, wall, or structure with a gate around the buildings only, the locations were depicted as "on entity" at the center of the facility. If the facility's buildings are not enclosed, the locations were depicted as "on entity" on the main building or "block face" on the correct street segment.

oregon emergency preparedness public health departments community facilities administrative Government Oregon Public Health Departments 2010-02-19 State and Local Public Health Departments

Governmental public health departments are responsible for creating and maintaining conditions that keep people healthy. A local health department may be locally governed, part of a region or district, be an office or an administrative unit of the state health department, or a hybrid of these. Furthermore, each community has a unique "public health system" comprising individuals and public and private entities that are engaged in activities that affect the public's health.
(Excerpted from the Operational Definition of a functional local health department, National Association of County and City Health Officials, November 2005)
Please reference <http://www.naccho.org/topics/infrastructure/accreditation/upload/OperationalDefinitionBrochure-2.pdf> for more information.

Facilities involved in direct patient care are intended to be excluded from this dataset; however, some of the entities represented in this dataset serve as both administrative and clinical locations.

This dataset only includes the headquarters of Public Health Departments, not their satellite offices.

Some health departments encompass multiple counties; therefore, not every county will be represented by an individual record. Also, some areas will appear to have over representation depending on the structure of the health departments in that particular region.

Visiting nurses are represented in this dataset if they are contracted through the local government to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the local health organization.

Effort was made by TechniGraphics to verify whether or not each health department tracks statistics on communicable diseases.

oregon preparedness emergency nursing home nursing_home facility facilities long term care ltc disabled care treatment assisted living assisted Government Oregon Nursing Homes 2010-02-26 A nursing home is commonly referred to as a skilled nursing facility, long term care (LTC) facility, or rest home, and may have a different standardized name throughout the United States, but is most commonly referred to as a nursing home. A nursing home traditionally offers 24-hour (skilled) nursing to the elderly or to disabled patients having a variety of medical conditions who require personal care services above that of an assisted living but do not require hospitalization. The personal care services provided may or may not include, but are not limited to: skilled nursing, long term inpatient care, room and board, meals, laundry, and assistance with: dressing, grooming, getting in and out of bed, medications, bathing, and toileting.

For purposes of this dataset, an assisted living facility is defined as a facility where the elderly, who are not related to the operator, reside and receive care, treatment, or services. Although not at the level of a nursing home, the services are above the level of an independent living community. They may include several hours per week of supportive care, personal care, or nursing care per resident. Generally, an assisted living facility offers help in daily living (laundry, cooking, cleaning, etc.) and personal assistance (bathing, eating, clothing, etc.). Many assisted living facilities offer assistance with medication and a lesser level of nursing care than what is offered at a nursing home.

Assisted living facilities may be regulated by size restrictions depending on which type of assisted living facility it is considered to be in the state in which it exists. For example, Adult Family Homes in Wisconsin have between 3-4 elderly residents while Community Based Residential Facilities have 5 or more. Almost every state has different terminology to describe their version of the assisted living facility system.

The structures in which assisted living facilities exist are varied as well. Depending on the type, an assisted living facility may operate out of a personal residence or a nursing home style structure, and it may be set up as apartment style living or as a campus setting in a continuing care retirement community. Multiple assisted living facilities may exist at one location or may be co-located with nursing homes and/or other similar health care facilities.

If a facility is licensed by a state and holds multiple licenses, it is represented once in this dataset for each license, even if the licenses are for the same location.

This dataset does not include retirement communities, adult daycare facilities, or rehabilitation facilities. Nursing Homes that are operated by and co-located with a hospital are also excluded because the locations are included in the hospital dataset.
